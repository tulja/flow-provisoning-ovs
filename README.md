## Flow level Bandwidth Provisioning to the Docker Containers using OpenVSwitch (OVS)

### Dependencies for the setup
*    Ubuntu 16.04 
*    Docker

The goal of this Proof of Concept to show the flow level bandwidth provisioning using the OvS Switch. 
There are three phases of recognizing the attack.
*    Docker Networking using OVS 
*    Creation of OVS Queues 
*    Adding the Flow Rules
*    Test the Bandwidth Provisioning 


In this setup we have two Docker Containers. We attach the two docker containers to OVS and test the bandwidth provisioning using them. 

### Docker Networking using OvS

First of all we need to create the OVS based Docker Networking. 

*   Install OVS and ovs-docker utility
```
sudo su
apt-get -y install openvswitch-switch
cd /usr/bin
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openvswitch/ovs/master/utilities/ovs-docker
chmod a+rwx ovs-docker
```
*   To start the setup run the below command
```
cd Honeypot-Project/honeytraps/
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```
*  Check the status of containers 
```
docker ps
```

### Docker Networking using OvS

*  **HoneyTrap-1 (Adding Fake HTTP Ports for Listening)**
    * In this we will use additional ports of 8000,8080,8888 for listening
    * All the traffic that is received on these port is tagged malicious   
    * Open the browser and enter the HostIP with any of above three ports (like shown in the image below)
![Alt text](./screenshots/honeytrap1_bait.png?raw=true "Accessing Fake Ports")
	* Alternatively run the below command from terminal
```
curl <Host-IP>:8888/index.html
```
	*  Wait for a minute or two for the logs to reach the ELK
	*  Open http://localhost:5601/app/kibana in your browser 
	*  Go to Management in Kibana Dashboard and click Saved Objects
![Alt text](./screenshots/savedObj1.png?raw=true "Saved Object Creation")
	*  Click on Import and upload the export.json file as shown in below figure
![Alt text](./screenshots/savedObj2.png?raw=true "Saved Object Creation")
	*  Navigate to Discover Menu on the Left Hand Side and Honeytrap-1 Logs can be visualized in Kibana Dashboard

*  **HoneyTrap-2 (Adding Fake Disallow Entry in robots.txt file)**
    * Every website maintains its robots.txt to advise the allowed and disallowed entries to the crawler
    * Based on these entries, crawler should not access the Disallowed entries, but the Disallow is just a suggestion in the robots.txt, so we will add a fake Disallow entry in the robots.txt file
    * Whoever tries to access this location is marked malicious 
    * We can also have a fake authentication on this fake location to get the username/password pairs from the attacker  
    * Open the robots.txt page and try to access Fake Disallowed robots.txt Entry (like shown in the image below)
![Alt text](./screenshots/honeytrap2_bait.png?raw=true "Accessing Fake Disallow robots.txt Entry")
	* Access the fake location mentioned in the robots.txt file 
![Alt text](./screenshots/honeytrap2_bait_2.png?raw=true "Accessing Fake Disallow robots.txt Location + Authentication ")	
	* In the below log screenshot we can see that Attacker has used the Admin as Username and Password as "Password" to get access to the fake location mentioned in robots.txt, all the tries (of username/password) of attacker are logged at ELK

*  **HoneyTrap-3 (Adding Fake HTML Comments in the login page)**
    * In this trap, we will add a fake HTML comment in the login page, this fake comment redirects the attacker to some other location. Whoever tries to access this location is tagged malicious   
    * Open the Host-IP:9091/login.html in browser and try to access comments of page (like shown in the image below). The highlighted line in the below picture shows the fake HTML comment added by the ModSecurity
![Alt text](./screenshots/honeytrap3_bait.png?raw=true "Accessing Fake HTML comment")
	* Try to access the location mentioned in the HTML comment
![Alt text](./screenshots/honeytrap3_bait_2.png?raw=true "Accessing HTML comment specified location")	
	* In the below log screenshot we can see that Attacker is tagged
![Alt text](./screenshots/honeytrap3_logs.png?raw=true "Visualizing the Honeytrap-3 Logs")

*  **HoneyTrap-4 (Adding Fake Hidden Form Fields)**
	* HTML hidden form fields are just like normal form fields, except for one distinct difference: The browser doesnâ€™t display them to the user. Hidden fields are used as a mechanism to pass data from one request to another, and their contents are not supposed to be altered
	* This is how the raw HTML hidden form field looks in the source
	* `<input type="hidden" value="front" name="context">`
	* Just as we did with adding fake HTML comments, we can use the same methodology to inject fake HTML hidden form fields. The key to this technique is the closing `</form>` HTML tag. We will inject our honeytrap data just before it.
    * Whoever tries to manipulate this form field is tagged malicious   
    * Open the Host-IP:9091 in browser and try to access hidden form field of page (like shown in the image below). 
    The highlighted line in the below picture shows the fake HTML comment added by the ModSecurity
![Alt text](./screenshots/honeytrap4_bait.png?raw=true "Accessing Fake Hidden Form Field")
	* Change the hidden field value to true, put some data in the form and submit it
![Alt text](./screenshots/honeytrap4_bait_2.png?raw=true "Changing the hidden form field value")	
	* In the below log screenshot we can see that Attacker is tagged at ELK
![Alt text](./screenshots/honeytrap4_logs.png?raw=true "Visualizing the Honeytrap-4 Logs")

*  **HoneyTrap-5 (Adding Fake Cookies)**
	* The HTTP protocol has no built-in session awareness. This means that each transaction is independent from the others. The application, therefore, needs a method to track who someone is and what actions he has previously taken (for instance, in a multistep process). Cookies were created precisely for this purpose
	* The application issues `Set-Cookie` response header data to the client web browser.
	* Much like attackers take aim at parameter payloads, they also attempt to alter cookie data that the application hands out. This can be done with the tools like http://www.editthiscookie.com/ 
    * Open the Host-IP:9091 in browser and open the site information to access the cookie information (like shown in the image below). 
    The highlighted line in the below picture shows the cookie data is `Admin:0`
![Alt text](./screenshots/honeytrap5_bait.png?raw=true "Accessing Cookies")
	* We try change the cookie data using `editthiscookie` chrome-extension (you can others similar to this). We try to change `Admin:0` to `Admin:5` after that fill the form and submit the data 
![Alt text](./screenshots/honeytrap5_bait_2.png?raw=true "Changing the cookie value")	
	* In the below log screenshot we can see that Attacker is tagged at ELK who changed the cookie value

* Please check the modsecurity conf. file for more information about the honeytraps.

*  **Dashboard Visualization**
    *  Click on Dashboard from left hand side and click on Honeytrap Dashboard then you will see various information gathered through all honeytraps

*  **Issues**:
   * max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] is too low, increase to at least [262144], Run the below command 
   ```
        sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
   ```
   * If there is problem running with logstash, try with 
  ```
    /opt/logstash/bin/logstash --path.data /tmp/logstash/data -e filebeat_logstash.conf
```
